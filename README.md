# Hand-gesture-control-robotic-arm
 Hand gesture control robotic arm 
	
This project showcases a robotic arm controlled using real-time hand gestures detected through computer vision. Built for educational purposes under the KIDS initiative, the system uses a camera and OpenCV to track and interpret hand movements, enabling intuitive, touch-free control for pick-and-place tasks.

Key Features:

    Gesture Recognition: Real-time hand detection and gesture classification using computer vision

    Control System: Hand gestures mapped to robotic arm movements (e.g., open hand = pick, closed fist = release)

    User Interface: Also includes a GUI for manual control

Technical Details:

    Software: Python, OpenCV, VS Code, Linux

    Hardware: Jetson Nano (for processing), Arduino (for motor control), Robotic Arm Frame

This project provides hands-on learning in computer vision, human-computer interaction, and robotics integration, making it ideal for beginners exploring AI-powered control systems.
